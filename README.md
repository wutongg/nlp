# SI630 NLP Project Report: Building a Literature Review Helper Tool

This project aims to tackle the challenges associated
with the time-consuming nature and limited
processing capacity of manual exploratory
literature reviews by focusing on summarizing
research papers, particularly in the computer
science domain. We explored various models,
including extractive, abstractive, and combination
models, to find the most suitable approach
for paper summarization. Our findings
revealed that the best model was an extractive
LexRank model with clustering and sentence
transformers, which effectively generates concise
and informative summaries of scientific
papers, streamlining the literature review process.
